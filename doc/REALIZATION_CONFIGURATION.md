## Realization Configuration

TODO: Link to Doxygen build

A Realization Configuration needs to be in [JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)

The Configuration is a key-value object and must contain these three first level object keys:
* `global` 
  * is a key-value object that must include an object key for `formulations` that defines the default formulation(s) and also an object key for `forcing` that defines the default forcing file name pattern and path for any catchment that is not defined in `catchments`
  * Note: `global` can be omitted only if every catchment is assigned a formulation 
        
* `time`
  * is a key-value object that defines the simulation start and end times and the output interval

* `catchments` 
  *  is a key-value object that must include a list of individual catchments

```
{
   "global": {},
   "time": {},
   "catchments": {}
} 
```

The `global` key-value object must contain the following two object keys:
* `formulations` 
  * a list of formulation key-value objects that defines the default required formulation(s), and each formulation object has a key `name` and value of a model that is registered with the ngen framework and includes a key-value subobject for `params` 
  * Note: future versions could support breaking up `params` into additional key-value subobjects for `options` and `initial_conditions`
  * `params` must be a list that holds key-value pairs
* `forcing`
  * key-value object with keys for `file_pattern` and `path` that define the default CSV file pattern and path for the input forcings relative to the executable directory

The `global` key-value object *may* contain an `output_root` key for a user-defined root output directory for nexus and catchment outputs.

```
"global": {
  "formulations": [
    {
        "name": "tshirt_c",
        "params": {
            "maxsmc": 0.439,
            "wltsmc": 0.066,
            "satdk": 0.00000338
        ---continued---
    }
  ],
  "forcing": {
      "file_pattern": ".*{{id}}.*.csv",
      "path": "./data/forcing/"
  },
  "output_root": "/path/to/outputs/"
},  
```

The `time` key-value object must contain the following three keys:
* `start_time`
  * defines the UTC start time of the simulation and must be in the form `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss`
* `end_time`
  * defines the UTC end time of the simulation and must be in the form `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss`
* `output_interval`
  * defines the time interval that model outputs are generated in seconds

```
"time": {
    "start_time": "2015-12-01 00:00:00",
    "end_time": "2015-12-30 23:00:00",
    "output_interval": 3600
},
```

The `catchments` key-value object must contain a list of all of the catchment object keys that will have defined formulations, and each catchment key will have the following format:
* `cat-` 
  * followed by the unique integer identifier for the catchment

Each catchment is a key-value object and must have the following two object keys:
* `formulations`
  * a list of formulation key-value objects that defines the required formulation(s), and each formulation object has a key `name` and value of a model that is registered with the ngen framework and includes a key-value subobject for `params`
  * Note: future versions could support breaking up `params` into additional key-value subobjects for `options` and `initial_conditions`
  * `params` must be a list that holds key-value pairs
     
* `forcing`
  * key-value object with a key for `path` that defines the CSV file name and path for the input forcings relative to the executable directory
