     *
     * Execution Details
     * ------------------------
     * Depending on the sending rank and whether the current rank either is, or is on the same host as, the sending
     * rank, one of three things will occur as part of this function:
     *
     *  * execution of a sending logic block (the sending rank only)
     *  * execution of a receiving logic block (any destination rank; i.e., rank on a host different from sending rank)
     *  * bypassing of both communication logic blocks (ranks on same host as sending rank, except sending rank itself)
     *
     * The sending logic block loops over rank id values. If an id is for a destination rank, @see mpi_send_text_file
     * is used to send that destination rank its files.  Similarly, the receiving logic block uses
     * @see mpi_recv_text_file to receive its files, overwriting any that already exist.
     *
     * Optionally, an MPI barrier may be added after the execution/bypassing of the communication logic.
     *
     * During the communication logic, a status value is maintained for whether ALL executed communication actions have
     * been successful.  This value is initially set to ``true``.  Optionally, after the communication logic,
     * the function can sync this status across all ranks, setting every rank's status to ``false`` unless all of them
     * are ``true`` prior to the sync.  Finally, this status value is returned.
     *
     * @param baseCatchmentFile The base catchment data file from which the rank-specific files are derived.
     * @param baseNexusFile The base nexus data file from which the rank-specific files are derived.
     * @param sendingRank The rank that will be the source and send data to ranks on different hosts.
     * @param mpi_rank The rank of the current process.
     * @param mpi_num_procs The number of MPI ranks.
     * @param hostIdForRank Pointer to array of size ``mpi_num_procs`` that maps ranks (index) to hosts, with each
     *                      distinct host having some identifier value uniquely representing it within the array
     *                      (e.g., if hostIdForRank[0] == hostIdForRank[1] then rank 0 and rank 1 are on the same host).
     * @param syncReturnStatus Whether all ranks should AND-sync their return status before returning.
     * @param blockAll Whether an MPI barrier should be added before (when appropriate) syncing status and returning.
