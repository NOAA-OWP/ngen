         * Get the model response for the provided time step, executing the backing model formulation one or more times as
         * needed.
         *
         * Function assumes the backing model has been fully initialized an that any additional input values have been applied.
         *
         * The function throws an error if the index of a previously processed time step is supplied, except if it is the last
         * processed time step.  In that case, the appropriate value is returned as described below, but without executing any
         * model update.
         *
         * Assuming updating to the implied time is valid for the model, the function executes one or more model updates to
         * process future time steps for the necessary indexes.  Multiple time steps updates occur when the given future time
         * step index is not the next time step index to be processed.  Regardless, all processed time steps have the size
         * supplied in `t_delta`.
         *
         * However, it is possible to provide `t_index` and `t_delta` values that would result in the aggregate updates taking
         * the model's time beyond its `end_time` value.  In such cases, if the formulation config indicates this model is
         * not allow to exceed its set `end_time`, the function does not update the model and throws an error.
         *
         * The function will return the value of the primary output variable (see `get_bmi_main_output_var()`) for the given
         * time step after the model has been updated to that point. The type returned will always be a `double`, with other
         * numeric types being cast if necessary.
         *
         * The BMI spec requires for variable values to be passed to/from models via as arrays.  This function essentially
         * treats the variable array reference as if it were just a raw pointer and returns the `0`-th array value.
         *
         * @param t_index The index of the time step for which to run model calculations.
         * @param d_delta_s The duration, in seconds, of the time step for which to run model calculations.
         * @return The total discharge of the model for the given time step.
