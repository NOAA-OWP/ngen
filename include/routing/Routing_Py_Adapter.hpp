         * This may not even be the correct concept to implement this type of
         * "integrated" routing.  But the basic idea is that after a catchment 
         * update occurs, it contributes some amount of lateral flow to the channel
         * as represented by @p flow_vector and this flow should be routed down stream
         * for @p number_of_timesteps .  Note though, that all lateral inflows are required
         * for a single routing pass of the network, so this would probably end up being a
         * flow map that we pass to a custom t-route function that extracts the lateral inflow
         * vector for each identity and constructs the correct lateral inflow setup to make
         * a full routing pass.
         *
