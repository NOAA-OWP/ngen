**Description**:  
As we attempt to apply hydrological modeling at different scales, the traditional organizational structure and algorithms of model software begin to interfere with the ability of the model to represent complex and heterogeneous processes at appropriate scales.  While it is possible to do so, the code becomes highly specialized, and reasoning about the model and its states becomes more difficult.  Model implementations are often the result of taking for granted the availability of a particular form of data **and** solution -- attempting to map the solution to that data. This framework takes a data centric approach, organizing the data first and mapping appropriate solutions to the existing data.

This framework includes an encapsulation strategy which focuses on the hydrologic data first, and then builds a functional abstraction of hydrologic behavior.  This abstraction is naturally recursive, and unlocks a higher level of modeling and reasoning using computational modeling for hydrology.  This is done by organizing model components along well-defined flow boundaries, and then implementing strict APIâ€™s to define the movement of water amongst these components.  This organization also allows control and orchestration of first-class model components to leverage more sophisticated programming techniques and data structures.


  - **Technology stack**: Core Framework using C++ (minimum standard c++14) to provide polymorphic interfaces with reasonable systems integration.
  - **Status**:  Version 0.1.0 in initial development including interfaces, logical data model, and framework structure.  See  [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for revision details.

## Structural Diagrams

![Catchments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen/master/doc/images/hy_features_catchment_diagram.png)

**Catchments**: Catchments represent arbitrary spatial areas. They are the abstraction used to encapsulate a model. The three marked catchments could use three different models, 3 copies of the same model, or some combination of the previous options. 

![Realizations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen/master/doc/images/realization_relations.png)

**Realizations**: Different kinds of catchment realizations can be used to encapsulate different types of models. These models will have different types of relations with neighbors. When a relation exists between two adjacent catchments synchronization is necessary.

![Complex Realizations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen/master/doc/images/complex_realizations.png)

**Complex Realizations**: An important type of catchment realization is the complex catchment realization. This allows a single catchment to be represented by a network of higher detail catchment realizations and their relationships. This allows the modeled area to be represented at multiple levels of detail and supports dynamic high resolution nesting.

## Dependencies
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
- [CMake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake)
- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) only for testing
- [Boost.Geometry](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/compilation.html)

See the [Dependencies](doc/DEPENDENCIES.md) document for more information.

## Installation

Detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and get the project running.
This should be frequently tested to ensure reliability. Alternatively, link to
a separate [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) document.

## Configuration

If the software is configurable, describe it in detail, either here or in other documentation to which you link.

## Usage

To run the *ngen* engine, the following command line positional arguments are supported:
- `catchment_data_path` -- path to catchment data geojson input file.
- `catchment subset ids` -- list of comma separated ids (NO SPACES!!!) to subset the catchment data, i.e. 'cat-0,cat-1'
- `nexus_data_path` -- path to nexus data geojson input file
- `nexus subset ids` -- list of comma separated ids (NO SPACES!!!) to subset the nexus data, i.e. 'nex-0,nex-1'
- `realization_config_path` -- path to json configuration file for realization/formulations associated with the hydrofabric inputs.

An example of a complete invocation to run a subset of a hydrofabric.  If the realization configuration doesn't contain catchment definitions for the subset keys provided, the default `global` configuration is used.  Alternatively, if the realization configuration contains definitions that are not in the subset (or hydrofabric) keys, then a warning is produced and the formulation isn't created.
`./cmake-build-debug/ngen ./data/catchment_data.geojson "cat-27,cat-52" ./data/nexus_data.geojson "nex-26,nex-34" ./data/example_realization_config.json`

To simulate every catchment in the input hydrofabric, leave the subset lists empty, i.e.:
`ngen ./data/catchment_data.geojson "" ./data/nexus_data.geojson "" ./data/refactored_example_realization_config.json`

## How to test the software

The project uses the **Google Test** framework for creating automated tests for C++ code.

To execute the full collection of automated C++ tests, run the `test_all` target in **CMake**, then execute the generated executable.  Alternatively, replace `test_all` with `test_unit` or `test_integration` to run only those tests.
For example:
  
    cmake --build cmake-build-debug --target test_all -- -j 4
    ./cmake-build-debug/test/test_all
    
Or, if the build system has not yet been properly generated:

    git submodule update --init --recursive -- test/googletest
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -B cmake-build-debug -S .
    cmake --build cmake-build-debug --target test_all -- -j 4
    ./cmake-build-debug/test/test_all

See the [Testing ReadMe](test/README.md) file for a more thorough discussion of testing.

## How to debug the software

This is all developed via **CMake**, so a specific setting must be active within the root `CMakeList.txt` file:

    target_compile_options(ngen PUBLIC -g)
    
This will ensure that ngen and all of the code that is compiled with it has debugging flags enabled. From 
there, the application may be run via `gdb`, `lldb`, or through your IDE.

If you do not have administrative rights on your workstation, there's a chance you do _not_ have access to 
`gdb` or `lldb`, meaning that you cannot step through your code and inspect variables. To get around this, you 
can use GitPod to start an editor (based on VSCode) in your browser and edit and debug to your heart's content. 
You can access an individualized GitPod environment through: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/<your github username>/ngen. 
Entering it for the first time will generate a new git branch.

There are a few things required, however. When you first enter, gitpod will ask you if you want to set up your 
environment. Let it create a `.yml` configuration file. It will then ask if you want it to create a custom docker 
image. Say yes, then choose the default image. At the end, you should have a `.gitpod.yml` and `.gitpod.dockerfile` 
at the root of the project.

Next, you will need to add the above `target_compile_options(ngen PUBLIC -g)` just about anywhere in the `CMakeLists.txt` 
file within the root of your project.

Next, you will need to make sure that **all** dependencies are installed within your environment. The image GitPod supplies 
uses an application name HomeBrew to allow you to install dependencies. You will need to run:

    brew install boost
    
to proceed further. Now clear all of your previously built binaries and build your application (`ngen` or any test routine 
that you're interested in, such as `test_all`).

A debugging extension should be installed into your workspace. Select the bottom icon on the left hand side of your screen; 
it should look like a box with a square in it. CodeLLDB is a good extension to use.

Lastly, a debugging configuration must be set up. There is an icon on the left hand side of your screen that should be a 
bug with a slash through it, somewhat like a 'No Parking' sign. If you click it, it will open a debugging tab on the left 
hand side of your screen. Within it, you should see a play button next to a drop down menu that says 'No Configurations'. 
Click on that, then click on the option named "Add Configuration...". This will create a file named `launch.json`. Within it, 
add a configuration so that it looks like:


    {
      // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
      // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
      "version": "0.2.0",
      "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "ngen",
            "type": "lldb",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/<your build directory>/ngen",
            "args": [],
        }
      ]
    }

You will now have the configuration named `ngen` after saving your `launch.json` file. You may now add a break point within 
your code by clicking to the left of the line number within your code. This should make a red circle appear. Now, when you run 
it by clicking the play button in the debugging window, your code will stop on the line where you put your break point, as long 
as it executes code. It will **not** stop on whitespace or comments.
