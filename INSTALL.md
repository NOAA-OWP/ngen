# Installation instructions

At present, a standard installation process is not supported.

To use, first make sure all necessary [dependencies](doc/DEPENDENCIES.md) are installed, and then [build the main ngen target with CMake](doc/BUILDS_AND_CMAKE.md).  Then run the executable, as described [here for basic use](README.md#usage) or [here for distributed execution](doc/DISTRIBUTED_PROCESSING.md#examples).
